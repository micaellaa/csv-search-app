## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
- Git installed (optional).

## Getting Started

To set up and run the project:

1. Clone the repository (if you haven't already):

   git clone https://github.com/micaellaa/csv-search-app.git
   ```

   Alternatively, you can download the project as a ZIP archive from GitHub.

## Running the Application

1. Navigate to the project's root directory.

   ```
   Check that the content of this directory includes folders like "backend", and "csv-search-app" (the frontend project folder).
   Ensure that you are not inside the project frontend folder before running the next commands.
3. Install dependencies for the frontend and backend:
   ```bash
   npm run install-all
   ```
4. Start the frontend and backend concurrently:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
6. Access the application:

- Frontend: Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.
- Backend: Your backend server should be running on `http://localhost:3001`. You can access backend APIs using this base URL.
